# FDA Analysis of Rugby Player Vertical Jump Force Curves

# Project Overview
This project focuses on the application of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) techniques to gain insights from force curves obtained from rugby players during vertical jump exercises on a force platform. The project encompasses various stages of data processing, analysis, and interpretation, utilizing advanced statistical methods.

# Key Components
# 1. Data Collection
The project begins with the collection of force curves, capturing the dynamic changes in force over time during vertical jumps.
Each force curve represents the performance of a rugby player, creating a dataset of functional observations.
# 2. Data Preprocessing
Raw force curve data may contain noise and variability. Smoothing techniques are employed to enhance the quality of the data while preserving essential features.
Linear time normalization is applied to align the time scales, enabling meaningful comparisons across curves.
# 3. Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA)
FPCA is utilized to extract dominant patterns of variation within the force curves.
Principal components are identified, offering a concise representation of the variability in the data.
# 4. Functional Clustering
Functional clustering methods are employed to group similar force curve patterns.
This enables the categorization of rugby players based on their vertical jump force profiles, revealing underlying trends and differences.
# 5. Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis testing, such as functional t-tests, is conducted to assess significant differences between identified clusters.
The statistical analysis provides valuable insights into the impact of various factors on vertical jump performance.

# Project Benefits
The project contributes to a deeper understanding of force curve patterns in rugby players during vertical jumps.
Insights gained from FPCA and clustering can inform training strategies and injury prevention efforts.
Statistical analyses provide evidence-based recommendations for optimizing performance.
